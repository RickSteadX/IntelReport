# Excel Parser Horizontal Range Support Implementation

## Overview
This implementation fixes an issue in the Excel parser where horizontally placed ranges would cause data conflicts. The parser was fetching entire rows, which caused data from multiple ranges to be mixed when they were placed side by side.

## Problem Description
When two ranges were placed horizontally in Excel (side by side), the original parser would fetch entire rows, causing incorrect parsing results. For example:
- Log from parseNameValuePairs(): `['ОС РОВ', 7, empty, 'Склади', 0]`
- This shows data from two different systems being mixed in a single row

## Solution Implemented

### 1. New `parseNameValuePairs` Function
Created a new function that properly handles column layouts:
- Takes a range specification (e.g., "A1:C30")
- Extracts data only from specified columns within that range
- Respects column boundaries instead of fetching entire rows
- Supports different numbers of value columns (1 for recon systems, 2 for strike systems)

### 2. Updated `extractStrikeSystems` Function
Modified to use the new parsing approach:
- Uses `parseNameValuePairs` with `valueColumns = 2` for strike systems
- Correctly handles 2-value columns (hit count, destroyed count)
- Finds matching systems in the parsed data

### 3. Updated `extractReconSystems` Function
Modified to use the new parsing approach:
- Uses `parseNameValuePairs` with `valueColumns = 1` for recon systems
- Correctly handles 1-value column (detected count)
- Finds matching systems in the parsed data

## Key Benefits

1. **Column-Specific Parsing**: Only extracts data from specified columns within ranges
2. **Horizontal Range Support**: Works correctly with horizontally placed ranges
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with existing functionality
4. **Flexible Layout Support**: Adapts to various Excel layout configurations
5. **Correct Data Extraction**: Ensures each range is parsed independently without interference

## Testing Results

Testing confirmed that the solution correctly handles:
- Strike systems with 2 value columns (hit count, destroyed count)
- Recon systems with 1 value column (detected count)
- Horizontally placed ranges without data mixing
- Various layout configurations

Example test result:
```
Testing Strike Systems Range B1:D3:
  ОС РОВ: hit=7, destroyed=0
  Танки: hit=5, destroyed=3

Testing Recon Systems Range B1:C3:
  ОС РОВ: detected=7
  Танки: detected=5
```

The solution ensures that "ОС РОВ" is correctly parsed with value 7 and is not mixed with "Склади" when parsing strike systems range.

## Files Modified
- `src/utils/excelParser.ts`: 
  - Added `parseNameValuePairs` function
  - Modified `extractStrikeSystems` to use new parsing approach
  - Modified `extractReconSystems` to use new parsing approach

## How to Deploy
1. The changes have been committed to the `feature/dynamic-name-detection` branch
2. To push to the repository, run:
   ```
   cd IntelReport
   git push --set-upstream origin feature/dynamic-name-detection
   ```
3. Create a pull request to merge the changes into the main branch

## Verification
The implementation has been thoroughly tested with various scenarios including:
- Horizontally placed ranges
- Strike systems with 2-value columns
- Recon systems with 1-value columns
- Edge cases and various layout configurations

All tests pass successfully, confirming that the issue has been resolved.
